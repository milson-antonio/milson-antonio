<h2>👋 Hey! I'm Milson.</h2>

I'm a passionate Backend Developer with 6+ years of experience working mostly with Java and the Spring ecosystem.

🎓 I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [FURB](https://furb.br) (Brazil) and a Master’s in Computer Engineering with a focus on IoT from [UJA](https://ujaen.es) (Spain).

💻 Along the way, I’ve worked with C#, C++, Delphi, and more recently just for fun with Kotlin and Go.

⚙️ My daily work involves Spring Boot, Docker, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CI/CD pipelines, and other backend tech. I enjoy writing clean, maintainable, and testable code, and working in collaborative teams to ship better solutions.

🚀 I've contributed to various projects like migrating legacy systems to modern platforms, real-time location systems, tax collection platforms for city governments, and event/sports apps.
