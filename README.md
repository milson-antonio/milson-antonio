<h2>Hi! 👋 </h2>

I'm a Software Engineer specialized in the JVM-based ecosystem such as Java and Kotlin languages with over 6+ years of experience in Backend Development.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [FURB](https://furb.br) – Universidade Regional de Blumenau (Brazil, 2014-2018) and studied a Master’s in Computer Engineering at Universidad de Jaén - [UJA](https://ujaen.es) (Spain, 2018-2020).

Throughout my career, I’ve worked short time with Pascal/Delphi, C#, and C++, but my main language is Java with some occasional ventures into Kotlin. 

As a Java Developer, I’ve implemented, and deployed solutions using the Spring ecosystem, with a focus on microservices architecture, API development, and system performance. I also bring hands-on experience with modern backend tools and practices such as Docker, Message-Brokers, both relational and NoSQL databases and CI/CD pipelines. 

Over the years, I’ve contributed to projects involving the migration of legacy systems to modern web platforms, I've developed systems for sports and entertainment, tax collection systems for city governments and real time location systems for any industry.
